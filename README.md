## Layers and Keymap
This configuration uses ZMK firmware to manage multiple layers and custom keymaps. Below are the details of each layer along with screenshots.

### Base Layer
The base layer includes a singular sub-layer accessed via the "FN" key.

### Gaming Layer
The gaming layer is triggered by a combination of the "[" and "]" keys. This layer also has an additional sub-gaming layer for quick access to other parts of the keyboard without needing to move hands away from the mouse.
